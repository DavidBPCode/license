Create licenses for your open-source projects from the command-line. *Hello, productivity!*

## What is license?

`license` is a command-line utility to make licenses from the comfort of your terminal. 

#### Features

* Supports all the licenses available on GitHub
* Does not need network access (except on first run)
* Updates itself to the latest licenses in GitHub's API when possible
* Easy to customize the name, year, and output filename when needed

__Binary__: get the binary for your platform [here](https://github.com/nishanths/license/wiki/Install-binaries).

## Usage

#### Generate a license

To generate a license, simply run `license` followed by the license name. The following command generates the MIT license:

````bash
license mit
````

#### Create a license file

Use the `-o` option to save the license to a file. For example, the following command creates the file `LICENSE.txt` with the contents of the ISC license:

````
license -o LICENSE.txt isc
```` 

More options and commands are described below.

## Options

#### Customize name and year on the license

By default, license uses the current year on the generated license. To determine the name, license uses the following algorithm:

* First, it looks for command-line arguments
* If command-line args are absent, it looks at the environment variable `LICENSE_FULL_NAME`
* It then tries the name from git config and mercurial config
* Finally, it uses the current user's name via `os/user`
* As a last resort, it falls back to an empty string

The default ouput is suitable in most cases, but you can also explicitly specify the name and year:

````
license --name Alice --year 2013 mit
````


#### List available licenses

View the list of locally avaialable licenses by running:
