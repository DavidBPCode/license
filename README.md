# Install

#### Using go

````
$ go get github.com/nishanths/license
````

Make sure it works:

````
$ license --version   # should print version number
````

Check out [additional instructions](https://github.com/nishanths/license/wiki/Install-using-go) or [create an issue](https://github.com/nishanths/license/issues/new) if you run into trouble.

#### Binary

Alternatively, grab the binary for your platform [from the wiki page](https://github.com/nishanths/license/wiki/Install-binaries).

# Usage

#### Generating a license

To generate a license, simply run `license` followed by the license name. The following command, for example, generates the MIT license:

````bash
$ license mit
````

#### Creating a license file

Use the `-o` option to save the license to a file. The following command creates the file `LICENSE.txt` with the contents of the ISC license:

````
$ license -o LICENSE.txt isc
```` 

More options and commands are described below.

# Options

#### Customize name and year on the license

By default, license uses the current year for the year on the generated license. To determine the name, license uses the following algorithm:

* First, it looks at provided command-line arguments
* If command-line args are absent, it looks at the environment variable `LICENSE_FULL_NAME`
* Finally, it uses the name from git config and mercurial config.

You can explicitly specify the name and year to use:

````
$ license --name Alice --year 2013 mit
````


#### List available licenses

View the list of locally avaialable licenses by running:
